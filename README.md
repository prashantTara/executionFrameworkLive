1. do your code/changes in strategyConnector.cpp and other .h and .cpps
2. compile code using makeFile : "make"
3. execute binary with : "./simulator.out"
if it shows error "./simulator.out: error while loading shared libraries: libSimLib.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
run : "source libPathForExecution.sh"   (this will tell binary to look for shared library at given path)
